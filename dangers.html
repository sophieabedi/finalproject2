    <p>why are scam links so dangerous?</p>
  </div>
  <p>it may be obvious why scam links can be so dangerous, not only to yourself, but friends, coworkers, and
   mainly anyone following or friended with your hijacked account could be detrimental to other people. scam links can
 take you to a webpage that causes malware or ransomware to be put onto your computer, or automatically download a virus.
nonetheless, people need to be safe when on the internet to avoid these scams that are all around social media & the internet.
the only way to be truly safe is to make sure you do not click on suspicious links (as shown in the home page) or use a url scanner if you
are unsure if it is safe or not. if your account does end up getting hacked, the scammer will send that same virus to anyone in your dm's, emails, messages, and more.</p>
