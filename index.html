      <p>what are scam links?</p>
    </div>

      <p>scam links are a type of phishing scam in which an account tricks you to gain your trust (can be a friend/colleague). these scams can release your personal data, and gain access
      to your accounts just by clicking on it. some scam links download malicious files while others lead to a scam website.</p>

      <div class="maintitle">
      <p>what do scam links look like?</p>
    </div>
      <p>there are many different types of scam links out there. many of them consist of trustworthy sites that are mispelled (ex: instagnam instead of instagram). many people
        would believe this is a trustworthy site since it is instagram, but since it is mispelled it is almost always a scam link and should not be clicked on. other scam links can be
        of a shortened link (ex: tinyurl & bitly). These are not always scams, but it is important to double check with a url scanner if it is safe.</p>

      <p>youtube scams</p>
    </div>
      <p>youtube scams are an issue that continues to be present on youtube. one aspect of youtube scams that i consistently see while watching
      any youtube video is through the comments. now, i love reading through the comments on any youtube video i watch. i like to read other people's opinions on the video and it has always been
     a thing of mine to make sure to check the comments. from when i can remember, these scam links, known as 'free giveaway' scams have always been in the comments, especially if the video has 50k+ views.
    scammers will impersonate verified youtubers to gain the trust of those who are more vulnerable. although it is very easy to realize it is a fake account if you check their profile, it has become an
  issue amongst younger audiences who do not know better.</p>

      <p>discord scams</p>
    </div>
      <p>discord scam links are an ever present issue that are extremely common in private messages and huge servers. there are so many variations of scam links, ranging from 'free nitro' scams to
      ones that access your steam account. most of these scams include mispelled words (discord as discordn / steam as steamn). The problem with these types of scams is how they gain access to your discord account, and will send those
    same scams to your friends and any servers that you are in. personally, i have dealt with these scam links as i am a moderator in multiple servers (so i take care of deleting these links). the reason scammers want to access your account is
   mainly to sell it. scammers can make money off of your account based on the following criteria: discord nitro, special badges, and moderator/admin positions. </p>
