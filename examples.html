  <p>what are some stories from people who have been scammed from these links?</p>
</div>
<p>personal: i have had my fair sure of scam links, but from what i can remember, i don't think i ever fell for
scam links, but there have been times where i have almost been scammed because of a real person.
i was about 15 and was looking for sold out tickets to a billie eilish concert in LA. when looking online to see if anyone was selling,
i mistakenly chose to go to a person on instagram rather than an official 3rd party app (seatgeek, ticketmaster). this person was asking
for $500 for 2 tickets, and honestly it seemed like a good deal because of how close the seats were. when i tried to send them the money
for the tickets, it would not go through since my card had a limit on how much i spend in one day. this ended up being a blessing in
disguise because once i asked for proof of the tickets, they sent me an email from axs (a 3rd party app). i could tell something was off
with this email based on the mispelt words and very unprofessional wording. by then, i knew it was a scam and blocked them.</p>

<p>andrew's story: "It all started when Andrew saw his friend post a video on Instagram. In the video, the friend said he’d received a large return on
  a $3,000 cash investment in less than 24 hours, from working with an investment advisor. The friend tagged the advisor in the post, and added screenshots
  purporting to show how his investment had quickly ballooned to $40,000. Andrew felt suspicious, but intrigued: He and the friend shared an interest in the
  stock market and cryptocurrency. So he direct messaged the friend to learn more, and quickly received a personal endorsement of the strategy.
   Andrew, following instructions, put $1,000 in a Zelle account and another roughly $2,000 in bitcoin in Cash App. He gave the accounts’ information to the advisor,
   who sent Andrew a link to a site that appeared to be Forex, an online foreign exchange market. Within five minutes, Andrew watched his $3,000 investment jump to more than $42,000.
   Andrew recorded a video with disclaimers, saying he wasn’t endorsing the advisor’s services, and sent it to the advisor. The advisor then sent Andrew a link to extract his profits, but instead of leading to Forex, the link opened what appeared to be Instagram’s login page. Andrew entered his username and password, and was almost immediately locked out of his account.
At this point, Andrew says, he realized he had been conned. He called the police to file an incident report, opened up his side hustle’s Instagram account and started broadcasting warnings about his personal Instagram account and the account of the so-called advisor."

<br>
<p>conclusion: be skeptical of everything you see on the internet! do not easily trust others, especially if you do not know them personally. if it
feels like its a scam, it probably is. </p>
